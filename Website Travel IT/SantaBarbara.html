            <h2>What you have to visit in Santa Barbara</h2>
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>Mission Santa Barbara</li>
                <br>
                    <p>Called the "Queen of the Missions" for its graceful beauty and picturesque setting, Mission Santa Barbara is the city's most iconic landmark, and its style has strongly influenced the architecture of the city. This is the only California mission to remain with the Franciscans since its founding in 1786, and a community of Franciscan friars still lives here today.<br>

                      The current church was completed in 1820 and was built by Chumash Indians under the leadership of Father Antonio Ripoli after an earthquake destroyed the original chapel and surrounding buildings in 1812. Highlights include its Roman temple facade, twin towers (which are unique among the missions), and colonial-era art and sculptures. Today, the mission serves as a parish church - an evocative place to attend a service.<br>
                      
                      Also within the complex is a museum with art pieces from the colonial period and many interesting artifacts. Especially worth seeing is the beautiful La Huerta Historical Garden, with mission-era plants such as citrus, grapes, pomegranates, and prickly pear, and the cemetery, where many prominent early Spaniards, as well as 4,000 Chumash Indians, found their last resting-place. You can tour the complex on your own or join a scheduled docent-led tour on certain days.<br>
                      
                      After visiting the mission, wander across the street and explore the ruins of the old mission aqueduct, built by the Chumash Indians in 1806, and if you have time, stop by the fragrant Mission Rose Garden, a lovely place for a picnic on a sunny day.</p>

                <li>Stearns Wharf</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>At the bottom of State Street, in downtown Santa Barbara, Stearns Wharf offers breathtaking views of the harbor and beaches, backed by the Santa Ynez Mountains. It was built in 1872 and was, at the time, the longest deep-water pier between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Today, this tourist magnet is home to specialty shops; restaurants; and the Sea Center, one of two sites of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. This is a great place to stroll around with an ice-cream or enjoy a seafood lunch with ocean views. You can also visit the bait and tackle shop and cast a line off the end of the pier (look out for harbor seals). If you have kids, a fun way to arrive here is to catch the Lil' Toot water taxi from the Santa Barbara Harbor.<br>

                      A great way to explore the area around Stearns Wharf is to rent a bike from one of the nearby rental shops and pedal along the beachfront bike paths that trace the coastline near the entry to the wharf. If you want to stay right near this buzzing tourist hub, some of Santa Barbara's best beach resorts overlook the shoreline on either side of the wharf.</p>

                <li>Santa Barbara County Courthouse</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Completed in 1929, after an earthquake destroyed much of the city in 1925, this National (and State) Historic Landmark is one of the architectural jewels of the city. This downtown building occupies a full city block and is an example of Spanish-Colonial Revival style. As you wander the tiled corridors, notice the hand-painted ceilings; ornate tilework, some of which is from Tunisia and Spain; and wrought-iron chandeliers. Another highlight is the Mural Room, which tells the story of Santa Barbara's history. Free docent-guided tours are available at scheduled times.<br>

                      Surrounding the courthouse is a beautiful sunken garden, with palms and plants from more than 25 different countries, where concerts, community events, and weddings are often staged. For gorgeous views over the red-tiled roofs of the city towards the ocean, take the elevator to the top of the 85-foot El Mirador clock tower, a popular place for wedding proposals.</p>

                <li>Santa Barbara Zoo</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Encompassing more than 30 acres, Santa Barbara Zoo boasts a beautiful setting on a hilltop overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Its large, open spaces and lush gardens of palms and native plants impart the feel of a botanical garden, making it a lovely place to stroll around. For such a small zoo, you'll find an impressive variety of animals here. Highlights include the lions, snow leopards, Asian elephants, California condors, and western lowland gorilla exhibit. The zoo also offers fun interactive experiences such as the Barnyard and the giraffe feeding station. If you want a quick overview of the exhibits, hop aboard the zoo train, which travels around the exhibits and offers beautiful views along the way. Fun family events include Boo at the Zoo and Sleepover Safaris.</p>

                <li>Paseo Nuevo and State Street Shopping</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Santa Barbara is a haven for shoppers, and the epicenter of all the action is State Street downtown. Here, you'll find Spanish-style Paseo Nuevo, a picturesque outdoor shopping mall punctuated by potted palms and fountains. Nordstrom anchors the mall, and a host of fabulous boutiques, big-name chain stores, and cafes line the paved walkways between. Paseo Nuevo is especially beautiful when it's decorated for the holidays. Even if you don't buy anything, it's still fun to stroll around here.<br>

                      From Paseo Nuevo, you can also wander along State Street and browse other specialty shops, antique stores, and boutiques. Cafes and restaurants spill out onto the sidewalks here and make great people-watching spots. On Tuesday afternoons, State Street hosts the popular Santa Barbara Farmers Market, with fresh, locally grown produce.</p>
