            <h2>What you have to visit in Vancouver</h2>
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>Stanley Park</li>
                <br>
                    <p>Stanley Park is a lush peninsula of huge trees adjacent to Downtown Vancouver. If you are looking to get outside and enjoy some nature, this is the best place to visit in Vancouver. A paved seawall path encircles the green space and is a wonderful place to explore on foot or by bicycle.<br>

                      Inland, the park offers many things to do, and you can spend a full day exploring attractions like the totem poles at Brockton Point or the Vancouver Aquarium. Spectacular views are a standard throughout the park either back towards the city or out to the ocean.<br>
                      
                      Come spring, the park's gardens and shrubs burst into a rainbow of beautiful colors, led by the cherry trees and closely followed by the rhododendrons.<br>
                      
                      In the summer, an outdoor pool operates right at the edge of the ocean. This 80-meter pool is heated and is a popular spot for families because of its gently sloped entry.<br>
                        
                        </p>

                    <br>
                <li>Granville Island</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once mainly industrial, Granville Island is now a thriving center of activity with a relaxed and distinctive atmosphere. Artists and retailers have moved into converted warehouses alongside houseboats, theaters, galleries, and restaurants.<br>

                      The Granville Island Public Market is one of the most popular attractions selling fruit and vegetables, seafood, and a great variety of other specialties as well as ready-to-eat items. Not truly an island, the arts hub is linked to residential areas by one road and footbridges to the south, and to the Downtown peninsula (across False Creek) by ferry.</p>
                    <div class="text-center">

                    <br>
                <li>Grouse Mountain</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>In both winter and summer, Grouse Mountain offers an unmatched panorama in clear weather. That's especially so in the evenings when the city lights are on.<br>

                      A gondola operates daily running from street level to the summit, where dining, activities, and wildlife await mountaintop explorers year-round.<br>
                      
                      When the snow flies, Grouse Mountain is a winter wonderland offering outdoor skating, snowshoeing, skiing, and snowboarding. The ski runs are not particularly difficult, and Grouse Mountain is a fun family outing. It's also a great place to learn how to ski.<br>
                      
                      Come summer, Grouse Mountain is a hiker's paradise with trails, including the famed Grouse Grind - affectionately called Mother Nature's StairMaster.<br>
                      
                      If you are staying downtown, consider this tour: North Shore Day Trip from Vancouver: Capilano Suspension Bridge & Grouse Mountain. On this 6.5-hour tour, you'll hit two of the major attractions on the North Shore.</p>

                <li>Canada Place</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you arrive in Vancouver on a cruise ship, Canada Place is where your trip begins. The unusual roof design creates the impression of a huge sailing vessel. The architecturally remarkable structure is part cruise ship terminal, part convention center and hotel, and part hub for sightseeing bus tours.<br>

                      At the end of the pier are panoramic views and the Flyover Canada attraction - a flight simulator that assaults all your senses while giving you a Canadian geography lesson. Also nearby, Waterfront Station is a major transit hub with ferries departing for the public market at Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver.<br>
                      
                      If you exit the building and turn right, a scenic waterfront walk towards Stanley Park begins. Along the way, you'll see the seaplanes take off and land, and massive seagoing container ships heading out to sea.<br> <br>
                      
                      Address: 999 Canada Place, Vancouver</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Oceanfront English Bay centers on one of the city's loveliest and busiest beaches. Part of the West End neighborhood, English Bay offers shopping and high-end restaurants, but is also a popular outdoor area where people come to walk, bike, rollerblade, or hang out with the public art installations.<br>

                      English Bay is not far from Stanley Park, and a waterfront trail joins the two. The beach is strewn with large tree trunks, which make a perfect back rest for sunbathers.<br>
                      
                      One of the biggest events of the summer is Celebration of Light. Generally occurring around the last week of July, spectacular fireworks are set to music. Another popular event is the New Year's Day Polar Bear Swim, when hardy swimmers take a dip in the chilly Pacific waters.<br>

                <li>Capilano Suspension Bridge</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Vancouver's first tourist attraction opened in 1889 and has been thrilling visitors with its swaying bridge over a plummeting canyon ever since. The footbridge spans a 70-meter deep river canyon leading to an activity park filled with forest trails and a treetop walk through old-growth giants. There's also a collection of totem poles and a transparent suspended platform known as the Cliffwalk.<br>

                      If you are staying in Vancouver, the Capilano Suspension Bridge Admission, with a free shuttle to the site, is a convenient option. The shuttle runs from downtown Vancouver, and the ticket covers admission to the Capilano Suspension Bridge, including the TreeTops Adventure and the thrilling Cliffwalk.<br>
                      
                      Also along Capilano Road, Capilano Salmon Hatchery is worth a visit (in fall especially) to spot flashing salmon as they try to swim upstream. The fish ladder - a series of staggered pools - allows fish to bypass Cleveland Dam. Check out the underwater windows for a first-hand look at their efforts.</p>

                <li>Robson Street</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Robson Street is best known for shopping. But international brand names aside, it's also the setting for many inventive Vancouver happenings.<br>

                      The main hub of activity on Robson Street is centered between Burrard and Jarvis Streets. Over these three blocks, you'll find over 150 stores and restaurants.<br>
                      
                      The city's premier arts institution, the Vancouver Art Gallery is on Robson and houses an excellent collection of paintings by Emily Carr (1871-1945) as well as visiting international exhibits. The gallery faces Robson Square, an interesting public space designed by Arthur Erickson, which includes a winter ice-skating rink and law courts.</p>

                <li>Whale Watching</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>The waters off Vancouver's coastline, known as the Salish Sea, are an excellent place to see whales. Humpback and gray whales, along with smaller minke and orcas swim in these waters.<br>

                      The main whale watching season runs from March through October. Options for seeing the whales range from aerial viewing from a float plane to Zodiac boats, or for those looking for a more stable platform, larger tour boats. If you are lucky, you might even spot a few whales from the BC ferries that transit between Vancouver and Victoria.<br>
                      
                      Strict regulations are in place that limit how close the boats can get to the whales. A popular option leaves from in front of the Westin Hotel in downtown Vancouver. The Half-Day Whale Watching Adventure from Vancouver takes you out on a 62-foot vessel that holds 74 people. Along the way, interesting commentary is provided. You'll have a good chance of sighting a whale from one of the multiple viewing decks.</p>
