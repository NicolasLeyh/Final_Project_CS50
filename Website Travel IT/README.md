# Final Project 

My final project in the "CS50 introduction to computer science" class refers to what I have learned about web design and its implementation.

I decided that my website refers to one of my favorite hobbies, traveling. Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I created an interactive website that shares my experiences and tips about each destination for global travelers. I am going to update each destinations information on a regular basis, as well as adding more of them from time to time.

On a total of 7 HTML pages, I have developed a website that provides general information about my travel destinations in the last three years. It lists the most famous attractions of each destination and explains them briefly. I also added a few extra features in order to make each side more interactive and aesthetically pleasing.

The website includes a home page (index.html) and the HTML pages of each destination (Bali.html, Singapore.html, ...).
There are several ways to get to the HTML pages of each destination and back to the home-page.
The rest of the information can be found in the code and on the website itself. 

Additionally, Sass was used, and with the Live Sass Compiler, this code was converted to CSS. (input.scss, input.css.map, input.css)

This project was a lot of fun, and I am thankful to have been part of this sensational course with great people and lecturers!
