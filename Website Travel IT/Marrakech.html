            <h2>What you have to visit in Marrakesh</h2>
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>Medina Souks</li>
                <br>
                    <p>For many visitors, Marrakesh's labyrinthine medina (old city) district is the town's star attraction. The narrow alleyways are a kaleidoscope of colors, scents, and sounds and are bound to be the sightseeing highlight of your trip.<br>

                      As well as simply wandering (and getting lost) amid the bustling maze, there are myriad shopping opportunities, where you can put your haggling hat on and barter to your heart's content. Shoppers shouldn't miss the Babouche (shoe) Souk, Chouari (carpenter's) Souk, El-Attarine (perfume and spice) Souk, and the Cherratine (leather) Souk.<br>
                      
                      Just west of the main souk area, at the end of Rue Bab Debbagh, you'll find Marrakesh's tanneries, where animal skins are still dyed the old-fashioned way.
                      
                      </p>

                <li>Djemaa El Fna</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>This large square at the entry to the medina is the center of Marrakesh life. The Djemaa El Fna (assembly place of the nobodies) is a vibrant hub of bric-a-brac stalls, musicians, storytellers, fortune-tellers, and snake charmers that never seems to rest. Here, the entire spectrum of Moroccan life enfolds before you. If being down among the thrum becomes too much, it's also easy to escape to one of the many surrounding rooftop caf√©s and restaurants, where you can survey the crazy scene from above.</p>

                <li>Koutoubia Mosque</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Koutoubia Mosque is Marrakesh's most famous landmark with its striking, 70-meter-tall minaret visible for miles in every direction. Local Marrakesh legend tells that when first built, the muezzin (man who calls the faithful to pray) for this mosque had to be blind, as the minaret was so tall, it overlooked the ruler's harem. The mosque was built in 1162 and is one of the great achievements of Almohad architecture. Non-Muslims are not allowed into the mosque itself.</p>

                <li>Medersa Ben Youssef</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Built in 1565 by the Saadians, the Medersa (madrassa - Islamic school of learning) of Ben Youssef is the largest theological college in Morocco. The warrens of rooms (with student cells that once were home to 900 pupils) are clustered around small internal courtyards in typical Islamic architecture style, but the main internal courtyard is the real highlight here. The fine zellige tiling, stalactite ceilings, cedar-wood detailing, and Kufic inscriptions used as decoration across the courtyard's interior make this medersa one of Morocco's most beautiful buildings and a star medina attraction.</p>

                <li>Saadian Tombs</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>This 16th-century burial ground is home to 66 members of the Saadian dynasty, which ruled over Marrakesh between 1524 and 1668. The tombs here include that of the ruler Al-Mansour, his successors, and their closest family members. It's a rambling, atmospheric place, with the mausoleums set amid a rather overgrown garden.

                      In particular, the main mausoleum (where Moulay Yazid is buried) has a fine surviving mihrab (prayer niche). The Saadian Tombs were walled up by their Alawite successors and were only rediscovered in the early 20th century.

                    <br>
                    <p>This magnificent peacock of a palace was built in the late 19th century as the residence of the Grand Vizier Bou Ahmed, who served Sultan Moulay al-Hassan I. The interior decoration is a dazzling display of zellige tiles, painted ceilings, and ornate wrought-iron features showcasing the opulent lives of those high up in the sultan's favor at that time. The massive marble grand courtyard and opulent salons of the haram area are the two main attractions, while the lush internal courtyard of the grand riad, with its banana-leaf plants and citrus trees, is a tranquil respite from the city.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>These lush tropical gardens full of cacti, palms, and ferns, are the work of painter Jacques Majorelle. Originally from the town of Nancy in France, Majorelle came to Marrakesh for health reasons and became well known for his paintings of local Moroccan life. His most famous work, though, was this garden and the vibrant blue (the color now known as Majorelle blue) painter's studio he lived in on the grounds.<br>

                      After Majorelle's death in 1962, French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent bought the property, and upon his death in 2008, his ashes were scattered in the gardens. Majorelle's old painting studio is now home to a fabulous museum dedicated to Berber artistry. A museum dedicated to YSL's life and famed fashion legacy is currently being built on the grounds as well.</p>

                <li>Badi Palace</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>The ruins of Al-Mansour's once grand palace are one of the kasbah area's most atmospheric sights. The Saadian ruler built the opulent palace, with pavilions set amid a mammoth garden of reflective pools, during his triumphant reign, but it was plundered and destroyed soon after. Now the sparse remnants of mosaic-tiled floors, ruined pavilions, and the high enclosing walls are all that remain. There are excellent views across the medina from the top of the walls, where storks have also built their nests.<br>

                      After viewing the palace, head to the Mellah, the old Jewish quarter of Marrakesh. It was established in the 16th century and is now populated mainly by Muslims. The small synagogue here has been nicely restored and can be visited as can the vast Jewish cemetery.</p>
